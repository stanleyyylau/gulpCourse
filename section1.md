# Getting Setup

## Installing Node.js & NPM

+ Use ``node -v`` to check if you have Node installed
+ Use ``npm -v`` to check if you have npm installed


## Using the terminal (It's not that bad)

+ echo (take a parameter and output it)
+ ls
+ cd (use '' if there's space in folder name)
+ pwd
+ clear (clr if you're on window)



## Installing Gulp

+ Use ``npm install gulp`` to install it (flag is needed to make a globally avarible, use ``sudo`` if you're on Mac)
+ Use ``gulp -v`` to check if you have gulp installed
